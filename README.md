# PHP Website for INLS 161 Honors Project

Since this is a PHP based website it needs to run in an environment where PHP is available. For most students in INLS 161, this will require you to set up a PHP environment on your computer. However, you may bypass working on you computer and edit your files **on GitHub** in your own clone of this repository. Then you can then, in turn, clone your repository to the OPAL server. 

## Setup

1. Set up a GitHub Account if you do not have one.
2. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
3. Log into Opal with GitBash or Command Prompt and git clone your repository to your OPAL account.
