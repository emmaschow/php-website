       <p>Although I love education and improving my mind in class, I also manage to stay occupied during my free time. I am in the marching band at UNC, which takes up most of my evenings during the week. I also enjoy yoga and try to do it as much as possible, but it has been difficult to maintain a schedule for that while at school this year. Spending time with my dog is my favorite way to pass time. She is a border collie, and she loves to catch frisbees.</p>
